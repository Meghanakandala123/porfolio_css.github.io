     <h2>1:AUTOMATED PENALTY COLLECTION SYSTEM FOR TRAFFIC SIGNAL VIOLATION</h2>
    <h3 style="color:blue;border: 5px ridge whitesmoke;width:100px;background-color: aqua;">Abstract</h3>
    <p>Due to the increase in traffic problems, there are number of cases of breaking red signals daily. To overcome this problem a system entitled “Automated Penalty Collection System for Traffic Signal Violation” using IoT is developed. 
        The purpose of the project is to track the traffic signal violations with the use of an RFID tag and IR sensor. The proposal mainly discusses the use of the system for taking proper action against traffic signal violations at the correct time, when any 
        vehicle violates the traffic signal RFID reader will read the RFID tag on that vehicle, collect fine and send notification to the owner. If RFID tags are not available then it consider as a violated activity. In this case, cameras are used to monitor that
         violated activity.In this system, Arduino UNO is used for processing the information. Here IR sensor  is used to detect the presence of a vehicle that is placed at the junction. If any vehicle crossed the sensor when the traffic signal is red, the Node MCU
          camera will monitor the vehicle and send it to the authorized person. And also RFID reader will read the tag and collect fine and send a message to the vehicle owner. When the emergency vehicle  comes closer to the traffic zone, the RFID READER in the 
          junction  senses  the RFID TAG. When  the codes are matched between the RFID READER and the RFID TAG , the arrival of the emergency vehicle is detected and this information is given from the microcontroller(ARDUINO UNO) to the control room.

        <h2>2:WATER LEVEL INDICATOR</h2>
        <p><p class="b">Description:</p> A water level indicator is a system that relays information back to a control panel to  indicate whether a body of water has a high or low water level. Here we indicate the level of water 
            based of lights.This will help to control the overflow of water from tanks.The technology used here is Embedded systems.The purpose of a water level indicator is to gauge and manage water levels in a 
            water tank. The control panel can also be programmed to automatically turn on a water pump once levels get too low and refill the water back to the adequate level.A water level indicator sensor, also 
            known as a probe sensor, is what tells the control panel that corrective action is needed. A combination of high and low sensors are used to tell the control panel when water levels are too high or too low. 
            The control panel will then automatically turn the pump on or off depending on the corrective action needed.</p>
